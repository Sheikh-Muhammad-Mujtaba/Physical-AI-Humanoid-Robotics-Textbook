Fix the critical build error in `textbook/src/contexts/ChatContext.tsx`.

**The Issue:**
The file currently has a circular dependency because it imports types from itself (`import ... from './ChatContext'`). This causes the build to fail with "module has no exports".

**Directives:**
1.  **Remove Imports:** Delete the line `import { ChatContextType, ... } from './ChatContext';`.
2.  **Define Interfaces Locally:** Move the interface definitions for `ChatMessage` and `ChatContextType` directly into this file at the top.
3.  **Ensure Exports:** Verify that `ChatProvider` and `useChat` are exported using the `export` keyword.
4.  **Preserve Logic:** Keep the existing state logic (isOpen, sessionId, etc.) and the mock `sendMessage` implementation.
