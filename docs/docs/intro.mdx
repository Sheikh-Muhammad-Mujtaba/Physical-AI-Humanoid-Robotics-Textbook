# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

<LearningObjectives objectives={frontMatter.learning_objectives} />

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook - a comprehensive 13-week course designed for industry practitioners with programming experience.

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and manipulate the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital spaces, Physical AI combines:

- **Perception**: Understanding the environment through sensors (cameras, LiDAR, force sensors)
- **Planning**: Reasoning about actions and their consequences in physical space
- **Action**: Executing precise movements through actuators and motors
- **Learning**: Adapting behavior based on physical interactions

## Course Overview

This comprehensive book will guide you through the exciting world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics across 5 distinct modules.

### Module 1: Introduction to Physical AI
Explore the foundational concepts of Physical AI, its core components, and the sense-plan-act cycle.

### Module 2: Humanoid Robotics
Delve into the anatomy of humanoid robots, their design principles, and the challenges involved in their development.

### Module 3: AI-Native Systems
Understand the paradigm shift towards AI-Native systems, where AI is foundational to design and operation.

### Module 4: Perception and Sensor Fusion for Physical AI
Discover how robots perceive their environment through diverse sensor modalities and how data from these sensors is fused for robust understanding.

### Module 5: Motion Planning and Control for Humanoid Robots
Learn the principles of kinematics, dynamics, trajectory generation, and whole-body control for achieving precise and stable humanoid robot movements.

## Who This Course Is For

- **Industry practitioners** looking to transition into robotics
- **Software engineers** with Python experience
- **Researchers** wanting hands-on robotics skills
- **Hobbyists** committed to a structured learning path

### Prerequisites
- Proficiency in **Python** programming
- Comfort with Linux/Ubuntu command line
- Basic understanding of linear algebra (vectors, matrices)
- 10-12 hours per week for 13 weeks

## Learning Approach

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:

1. **Learning Objectives**: What you'll be able to do after this chapter
2. **Prerequisites**: Required prior knowledge
3. **Content**: Concepts, examples, and explanations
4. **Hands-On Exercises**: Apply what you've learned
5. **Summary**: Key takeaways
6. **References**: Further reading and resources

## Getting Started



3. **Start Module 1**: [Introduction to Physical AI](/docs/module1-introduction-to-physical-ai/chapter1-what-is-physical-ai)

## Assessment Structure

Your learning will be validated through:

- **ROS 2 Package Project** (Week 5): Build a multi-node robotic system
- **Gazebo Simulation** (Week 7): Create a simulated environment
- **Isaac Perception Pipeline** (Week 10): Implement VSLAM and navigation
- **Capstone Project** (Week 13): End-to-end autonomous humanoid system

Each assessment includes detailed rubrics with three evaluation levels: Needs Improvement, Proficient, and Excellent.
