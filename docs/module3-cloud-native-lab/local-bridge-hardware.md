## The Local "Bridge": Connecting the Cloud to the Physical World

Even with a cloud-native lab, you cannot eliminate hardware entirely for "Physical AI." You still need edge devices to deploy your code physically and interact with the real world.

### Edge AI Kits

-   **Required:** You still need the **Jetson Kit** for the physical deployment phase of your projects.
-   **Cost:** ~$700 (One-time purchase).

### The Robot

-   **Required:** You still need one physical robot for the final demo.
-   **Cost:** ~$3,000 (Unitree Go2 Standard).
