## The Digital Twin: Simulation with Gazebo & Unity

Before deploying a robot in the real world, it's crucial to test and validate its behavior in a simulated environment. This is the concept of a **digital twin**—a virtual representation of a physical object or system.

### Physics Simulation and Environment Building

In this module, you will learn to use two powerful simulation tools:

-   **Gazebo:** A robust physics simulator that allows you to model complex environments and robot interactions. You will learn to simulate physics, gravity, and collisions.
-   **Unity:** A high-fidelity rendering engine that provides photorealistic visuals and enables rich human-robot interaction scenarios.

### Simulating the Senses

A robot is only as good as its ability to perceive the world. You will learn to simulate a variety of sensors, including:

-   **LiDAR:** For building 3D maps of the environment.
-   **Depth Cameras:** To perceive depth and distance.
-   **IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units):** For tracking orientation and acceleration.

### Weekly Breakdown (Weeks 6-7)

-   **Gazebo Simulation Environment:** Learn how to set up and configure a Gazebo simulation environment.
-   **Robot Descriptions:** Understand the URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and SDF (Simulation Description Format) for describing your robot.
-   **Physics and Sensor Simulation:** Dive deep into the details of simulating physics and sensors in Gazebo.
-   **Unity for Visualization:** Get an introduction to using Unity for high-quality robot visualization.
