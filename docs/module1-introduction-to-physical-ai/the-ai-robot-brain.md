## The AI-Robot Brain: Advanced Perception and Training with NVIDIA Isaac™

The "brain" of our robot is powered by the **NVIDIA Isaac™** platform, a powerful toolkit for developing AI-powered robots. This module focuses on advanced perception and training techniques.

### Key Components

-   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim:** A photorealistic simulation platform that allows you to generate synthetic data for training your AI models. This is a crucial step in the "sim-to-real" transfer process.
-   **Isaac ROS:** A collection of hardware-accelerated packages for ROS 2 that enable high-performance perception and navigation. We will focus on **VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** for real-time tracking and mapping.
-   **Nav2:** The navigation stack for ROS 2. We will use it for path planning, enabling our bipedal humanoid to navigate complex environments.
