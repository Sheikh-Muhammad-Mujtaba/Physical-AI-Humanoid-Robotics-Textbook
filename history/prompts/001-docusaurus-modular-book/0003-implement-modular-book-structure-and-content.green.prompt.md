## Prompt

ok now can you verify are we working on docasaurus markdown or react?

## Response snapshot

We are working with both. The book content is primarily written in Markdown files, which is then rendered by Docusaurus. Docusaurus itself is a React-based static site generator, so its components (like the navigation, layout, etc.) are built using React.

Implementation steps taken:
- Created the directory structure for the book modules.
- Created `_category_.json` files for each module.
- Created placeholder files for all chapters.
- Verified sidebar auto-generation.
- Wrote content for all chapters.
