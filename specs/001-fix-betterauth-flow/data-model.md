# Data Model: Fix BetterAuth Authentication Flow

No changes to the data model are required for this feature.

This feature focuses on fixing the authentication flow and configuration between the frontend and backend services. It does not introduce any new data entities or require modifications to existing ones. The core data models for `User` and `Session` are handled by BetterAuth and are not being altered.
