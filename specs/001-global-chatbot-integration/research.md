# Research Notes: Global Chatbot Integration (Root Architecture)

**Feature Branch**: `001-global-chatbot-integration`
**Created**: 2025-12-10

## Summary

No specific external research was required for this feature during the planning phase. The provided feature specification (from `prompt.txt`) was highly detailed, outlining architectural changes, component refactoring, and state management requirements with sufficient clarity. All key technologies and integration points (e.g., Docusaurus root, React Context for state management, existing backend communication) are well-understood within the project context, as confirmed by the Constitution Check.

Therefore, this document serves as an acknowledgment that all "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" points were resolved by the detailed nature of the initial prompt and existing project knowledge, allowing for direct progression to design and contracts.
