# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Educational Clarity**: Does the proposed content cater to beginners? Are there plans for diagrams or examples for complex topics?
- **Docusaurus-First Architecture**: Is the content structured for Docusaurus? Is frontmatter (`id`, `title`, `sidebar_position`) planned for all Markdown files?
- **Modular Content**: Are large topics broken down into smaller, atomic sub-chapters?
- **Single Source of Truth**: Is there a clear plan for handling imported content and archiving the master file?
- **Asset Management**: Is there a plan for storing images and static assets in `docs/static/img`?
- **Serverless Compatibility**: Is the backend designed to be stateless and compatible with Vercel Serverless Functions? Are global variables for database clients lazily initialized?
- **Type Safety**: Are all backend data exchanges defined using Pydantic models? Are loose dictionaries avoided for API payloads?
- **Modular Utilities**: Is shared logic separated into a `utils/` directory?
- **Secure Configuration**: Are API keys and sensitive configuration loaded from environment variables?
- **Frontend/Backend Separation**: Will the frontend communicate with the backend solely via `/api` endpoints, defined in a dedicated TypeScript service file?

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
