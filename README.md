# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## A Comprehensive Guide to AI-Native Systems

This repository hosts the source for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – AI-Native Systems," a comprehensive textbook meticulously crafted through an AI-driven, specification-driven development process. This book delves into the cutting-edge intersection of artificial intelligence and physical embodiment, providing a detailed guide for understanding and building intelligent robotic systems.

### About the Book

The textbook is structured into 5 distinct modules, each containing 3 chapters, designed to progressively build your understanding:

1.  **Module 1: Introduction to Physical AI**: Explores the foundational concepts of Physical AI, its core components, and the sense-plan-act cycle.
2.  **Module 2: Humanoid Robotics**: Delves into the anatomy of humanoid robots, their design principles, and the challenges involved in their development.
3.  **Module 3: AI-Native Systems**: Understands the paradigm shift towards AI-Native systems, where AI is foundational to design and operation.
4.  **Module 4: Perception and Sensor Fusion for Physical AI**: Discovers how robots perceive their environment through diverse sensor modalities and how data from these sensors is fused for robust understanding.
5.  **Module 5: Motion Planning and Control for Humanoid Robots**: Learns the principles of kinematics, dynamics, trajectory generation, and whole-body control for achieving precise and stable humanoid robot movements.

### Key Features:
